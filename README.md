Analysis of Quick Exit Rate Variability

I examined whether there is a significant variability in quick exit rate (QER) among different article variations within a sample of click tests. The purpose was to determine whether QER is a useful supplemental metric (in addition to CTR) for evaluating  the quality of articles. Among the sample of click tests, a small but non-trivial percentage of click tests demonstrated significant variability in QER. This suggests that QER might be a useful metric to look at when evaluating articles.

In addition, a follow-up analysis examined potential thresholds for triggering alerts for articles with unusually high (or low) QER. The most effective method was the Standard Boxplot Rule, which had good sensitivity for detecting outliers with a low false positive rate.
